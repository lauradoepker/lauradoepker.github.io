## About

I am a postodoctoral research fellow at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA.  I study how HIV infection affects antibody repertoires and the evolution of individual antibody lineages.  I am mentored by [Julie Overbaugh](https://research.fhcrc.org/overbaugh/en.html) (immunology and virology) and [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/) (computational biology).

I also play competeive mixed ultimate frisbee with [Birdfruit](https://seattlebirdfruit.com/) and fawn over my tiny dog Guppy ![Guppy](/Users/LauraNoges/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/private/com.apple.Photos/ExternalEditSessions/4MVbAGf9SHCafDBAYVfRlw)
