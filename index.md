## About

I am a postodoctoral research fellow at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA.  I study how HIV infection affects antibody repertoires and the evolution of individual antibody lineages.  I am mentored by [Julie Overbaugh](https://research.fhcrc.org/overbaugh/en.html) (immunology and virology) and [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/) (computational biology).

I also play competitive mixed ultimate frisbee with [Birdfruit](https://seattlebirdfruit.com/).

## Projects
- Studying the development of HIV-1-specific antibodies
- Computational antibody discovery
- Comparing human B cell repertoires between infants, adults, and HIV status
